Building a webpage from inside out!...
Working with Figma to design an awesome website, well that's exactly what I plan on doing.  What's the plan?  Well I don't know just yet, so I will update you as I go.  Fingers crossed that this site turns out good.  Get back with you in a little-bit!
Well, here's what I have discovered, I'm still struggling with Figma, easier to just work on the code for me and then try and put it all together.  I had help on this project is why it's halfway there. 

I actually took the rubics and all the data and worked from there.  I wrote it out then started with Figma.  I need to spend an entire day just studying Figma, right now I hate it!  Why because it hates me!  I have learned some things about it like adding color, choosing a phone, tablet or whatever.  My problem is getting the prototype to work properly.
